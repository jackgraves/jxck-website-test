A common reason for buying Atlassian products is due to their extensive integration with each other, it is also the reason why most Atlassian purchases are for more than one product.

The method by which the applications are connected to each other is through Application Links, which is fundamentally a plugin to the respective applications which lets you link the applications through OAuth (and the deprecated Trusted Application and Basic Auth methods) - however setting up these links and ensuring that they work correctly has always been a pain point, as troubleshooting had to be done by going through each link settings and using a link to a help article (not very helpful).

Following the release of the updated Application Links plugin, it is possible to see at-a-glance what the status of the links are and what the problem might be - by looking at the status lozenge of the respective link.

Check the latest updates available through the 'Manage Apps' section of your Server or Data Center product.
