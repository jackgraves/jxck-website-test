The Final Year Project that I chose to plan, develop, test and evaluate for my final year project at university (Final Year, Undergraduate) was:

> Spectrum: A PECS-based Messaging Mobile Application for People with Autism

> Spectrum is an Android application that helps children communicate between one-another using instant-messaging, however, instead of words and sentences, the application lets people communicate with pictures and to make sequences of pictures, or ‘cards’ to give meaning.

The application client is Android Phone and Tablet compatible, and works best with screens above 5", while the server is based in the Amazon AWS Cloud, running a PHP and MySQL Server.

The application has:

* Contact Pictures
* A Suggestion System
* Text-to-Speech System for reading Cards
* Push Notifications
* Enhanced Visibility Mode
* Gesture-based Composer
* A Horizontal Right-to-Left Conversation Screen
* An Interface which fits Android Guidelines
* A Picture Library (General, Animals, Colours, Items, Games etc.)
* Animated Interface/Elements
* New Contact Verification
* Compose and Ping a Contact

It is a mobile messaging application designed specifically for children with Autistic Spectrum Conditions (ASC) in the age range 6-12 who find it difficult to learn to speak and learn language skills.

A method of communication specifically designed for people with ASC conditions uses Picture Exchanges, which uses cards which each contain a picture which can be put together into a sequence to create and send a sentence between two devices running the Spectrum App.

The application was developed from requirements gathering to evaluation to ensure that the interface and design is specially suited to carers and children 6-12 who already use the Picture Card system. The application allows true Instant Messaging using the standard, to help develop childrens’ conversing skills.

Some screenshots and marketing images of the application are shown below:
